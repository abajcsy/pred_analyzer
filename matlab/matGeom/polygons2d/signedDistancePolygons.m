function [dist pts] = signedDistancePolygons(poly1, poly2)
%SIGNEDDISTANCEPOLYGONS Compute the signed distance between 2 polygons
%   DIST = signedDistancePolygons(POLY1, POLY2)
%   Returns the signed distance between 2 polygons
%
%   [DIST, POINTS] = signedDistancePolygons(POLY1, POLY2)
%   Also returns the 2 points involved with the distance. The
%   first point belongs to POLY1 and the second point belongs to POLY2.
